> the Palmetto Supercomputer at Clemson University,
> 2. Be able to install additional R libraries into your account on Palmetto,
> enabling additional data analytic tools, 
> 3. Be able to utilize *dplyr* to manipulate data,
> 4. Be able to utilize *ggplot* to visualize data,
> 5. Be able to optimize repetitive operations through function creations
> and loop enhancement, and
