# Introduction to Data Science using R

## Access to computing resources:

This workshop will utilize both your personal computers and computing resources from Clemson University's Palmetto Supercomputer.

**For personal computers, please make sure that:**

- You have R 3.4+ installed. The latest version of R can be found at https://www.r-project.org/
- You have the latest version of RStudio Desktop installed. This can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/

If you already have RStudio Desktop, please make sure that its version is 1.0 or higher

**For Palmetto, please make sure that:**

You have access to Palmetto. Access to Palmetto can be requested via the 
following online form: https://citi.sites.clemson.edu/new-account/

You can access Palmetto via one of the following methods:

- Palmetto's JupyterHub interface: https://palmetto.clemson.edu/jupyterhub
- Local terminal (for Mac and Linux)
- MobaXterm (Windows)

For more details on how to access Palmetto, please visit https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/userguide_basic_usage.html


## Workshop materials for local computers:

All notebooks and data used in the workshop are available online 
at https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01/raw/master/intro-to-r-rstudio.zip. 

You can download the designated compressed file, unzip it using your computers' unzip capability, 
and you will be able to view the files from inside RStudio Desktop. 


## Workshop materials for Palmetto:
We also have the same set of materials available in the form of Jupyter notebooks for Palmetto' JupyterHub interface.  
They can be found at: https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01/raw/master/intro-to-r.zip. To acquire and run these
materials on Palmetto, please follow these steps:

- You can download this compressed file from the above URL to your computer, and then upload the file to Palmetto using the **`Upload`** button located at the upper-right corner of the main JupyterHub home directory page. The file should be uploaded to your home directory. 

- You can also download this file via a terminal. To gain access to Palmetto's terminal in JupyterHub, click the **`New`** button located next to the **`Upload`** button and select **`Terminal`**. Inside the terminal, type the following and hit Enter:

```
  wget https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01/raw/master/intro-to-r.zip
```

- To decompress this file, open a terminal to Palmetto (see instructions above). Inside the terminal, type the following and hit Enter:

```
  unzip intro-to-r.tgz
```

- A new directory called **intro-to-r** should be created in your home directory. This directory contains all data and notebooks.
