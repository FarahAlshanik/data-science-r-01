# Introduction to Data Science using R

## Access to computing resources:

- This workshop will be presented using computing resources from Clemson University's Palmetto Supercomputer. 

- Access to Palmetto can be requested via the following online form: https://citi.sites.clemson.edu/new-account/

- We will be using Palmetto's JupyterHub interface: https://palmetto.clemson.edu/jupyterhub

- Resource allocation request: 1 chunk, 8 cores, 8gb ram, 24 hours walltime, workq

## Workshop materials:

- All notebooks and data used in the workshop are available at https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01/raw/master/intro-to-r.tgz

- You can download this compressed file from the above URL to your computer, and then upload the file to Palmetto using the **`Upload`** button located at the upper-right corner of the main JupyterHub home directory page. The file should be uploaded to your home directory. 

- You can also download this file via a terminal. To gain access to Palmett's terminal in JupyterHub, click the **`New`** button located next to the **`Upload`** button and select **`Terminal`**. Inside the terminal, type the following and hit Enter:

```
  wget https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01/raw/master/intro-to-r.tgz
```

- To decompress this file, open a terminal to Palmetto (see instructions above). Inside the terminal, type the following and hit Enter:

```
  tar xzf intro-to-r.tgz
```

- A new directory called **intro-to-r** should be created in your home directory. This directory contains all data and notebooks necessary for this workshop.
