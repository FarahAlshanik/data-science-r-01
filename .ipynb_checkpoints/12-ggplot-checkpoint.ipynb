    "## Plotting with ggplot2\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make the same plot using the `ggplot2` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots\n",
    "from data in a dataframe. It uses default settings, which help creating\n",
    "publication quality plots with a minimal amount of settings and tweaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "ggplot graphics are built step by step by adding new elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a ggplot we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bind the plot to a specific data frame using the `data` argument\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r, eval=FALSE}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- define aesthetics (`aes`), that maps variables in the data to axes on the plot\n",
    "     or to plotting size, shape color, etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r, eval=FALSE}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- add `geoms` -- graphical representation of the data in the plot (points,\n",
    "     lines, bars). To add a geom to the plot use `+` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r first-ggplot}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "  geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `+` in the `ggplot2` package is particularly useful because it allows you\n",
    "to modify existing `ggplot` objects. This means you can easily set up plot\n",
    "\"templates\" and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above\n",
    "plot can also be generated with code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r, first-ggplot-with-plus, eval=FALSE}\n",
    "# Create\n",
    "surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Draw the plot\n",
    "surveys_plot + geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers\n",
    "  that you add.  i.e. these are universal plot settings. This includes the x and\n",
    "  y axis you set up in `aes()`.\n",
    "- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the\n",
    "  aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building your plots iteratively\n",
    "\n",
    "Building plots with ggplot is typically an iterative process. We start by\n",
    "defining the dataset we'll use, lay the axes, and choose a geom.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r create-ggplot-object}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "    geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more infromation from it. For\n",
    "instance, we can add transparency (alpha) to avoid overplotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r adding-transparency}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add colors for all the points\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r adding-colors}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = \"blue\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to color each species in the plot differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r color-by-species}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color=species_id))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boxplot\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualising the distribution of weight within each species.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r boxplot}\n",
    "ggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n",
    "    geom_boxplot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding points to boxplot, we can have a better idea of the number of\n",
    "measurements and of their distribution:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer? What do you need to\n",
    "change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points such that it's not\n",
    "hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Challenges\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the *shape* of the distribution. For\n",
    "> example, if there is a bimodal distribution, this would not be observed with a\n",
    "> boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot (sometimes known as a\n",
    "> beanplot), where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see `geom_violin()`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In many types of data, it is important to consider the *scale* of the\n",
    "> observations.  For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to\n",
    "> better distribute the observations in the space of the plot.  Changing the scale\n",
    "> of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components (i.e., by\n",
    "> incrementally adding commands).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Represent weight on the log10 scale; see `scale_y_log10()`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Create boxplot for `hindfoot_length`.\n",

    "## Plotting time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate number of counts per year for each species. To do that we need\n",

    "## Faceting\n",
    "\n",
    "ggplot has a special technique called *faceting* that allows to split one plot\n",
