    "\n",
    "The package `dplyr` provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation\n",
    "tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames. The thinking behind it was\n",
    "largely inspired by the package `plyr` which has been in use for some time but\n",
    "suffered from being slow in some cases.` dplyr` addresses this by porting much\n",
    "of the computation to C++. An additional feature is the ability to work directly\n",
    "with data stored in an external database. The benefits of doing this are\n",
    "that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be\n",
    "conducted on that database, and only the results of the query returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in\n",
    "memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available\n",
    "memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you\n",
    "can have a database of many 100s GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull\n",
    "back just what you need for analysis in R.\n",
